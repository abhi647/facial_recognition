## Facial Recognition using OpenCV and Haar Cascade

Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. 
OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. 
I will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.
